With the ESO-Database Steam Deck Client you update the needed The Elder Scrolls Online AddOns and automatically upload the AddOn data after your game sessions with a background service.

You have to setup a superuser password in order to enable automatic uploads. For more information, see the <a href="#requirements">requirements</a> section.

## Requirements
First, head into Desktop mode if you havenâ€™t already. To do so, go to Power, then Desktop mode in the Steam button menu. Once loaded in, enter the menu on the taskbar and find Terminal. This will load up a terminal page.

Now, all you have to do is type `passwd`

After that, you will be prompted to choose and repeat the password. Once this is done, you can proceed to the <a href="#installation">Installation</a> section.

## Installation
Right-click on the following link and select "Save Link As" and save the file to your Steam deck in desktop mode.
